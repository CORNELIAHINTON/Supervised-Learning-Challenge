# Supervised Learning Challenge
 
<h2> Findings</h2>
When running the unscaled data, I found that the Logistic Regression (51% score) did not perform as the Random Forest Classifer  model (64% score). So I scaled the data using the Standard Scaler to determine if there would be a better outcome with the data. After scaling the data I found that the Logistic Regression (76% score) was much more successful than the Random Forest Classifier model. However, the Random Forest Classifier model did not perform successfully on the data overall, scoring even less on the scaled data at 63%.
